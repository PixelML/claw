## 🧠 The Manifesto: Why Claw Exists

**We don't build magic. We build Glass Boxes.**

Most AI tools are "Black Boxes"—you type something, and *something* happens. You cross your fingers. You hope. That's not how operators run a business.

**Claw is a "Glass Box."** You see everything. You control everything.

We treat your business operations like code compilation:

> **Draft → Plan → Simulate → Execute.**

Before any file is renamed, moved, or modified, you see a **Ghost File**—a translucent preview of the exact result. You verify at **zero risk**. Then, and only then, do you commit.

## ⚙️ The Architecture

| Component | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| 🦾 **The Body** | A blazing-fast local app (~10MB) built in **Rust & Tauri**. Runs on your machine. Holds your API keys. Handles all file I/O securely. |
| 🧠 **The Brain** | **AgenticFlow Cloud**. Handles complex, stateful reasoning tasks that require massive compute. Your Brain in the cloud. |
| 🌉 **The Bridge** | A secure, zero-config tunnel. Your local files connect to cloud intelligence—no manual uploads, no exposed drives. |

## 🔒 The "Glass Box" UX Philosophy

| Principle | What It Means |
|-----------|---------------|
| **🔍 Simulation First** | Every action is previewed before execution. No surprises. |
| **👻 Ghost Files** | See a translucent preview of file changes before they happen. Verify visually. |
| **🎚️ Safety Sliders** | Control how much autonomy you give the agent: from "Ask me before anything" (Intern) to "Just get it done" (Partner). |

## ✨ What Operators Use Claw For

- 📁 **"Auto-organize my Downloads folder by invoice date."**
- 📄 **"Extract data from these local PDFs directly into Notion."**
- 🖼️ **"Sanitize sensitive screenshots before I upload them."**
- 📊 **"Reconcile this local Excel sheet with my Stripe transactions."**
- 🏷️ **"Rename these 50 messy files based on their content."**
